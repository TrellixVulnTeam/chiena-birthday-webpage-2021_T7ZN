        Can you believe it? Just last year we were all celebrating your birthday
        in your backyard. So much has changed. Your birthday celebration might
        look a little different this year, but still no less special üòÅ. And
        honestlyy, I have a feeling that you've already found creative ways to
        celebrate with your loved ones.

        You know... its been a real pleasure getting to know you all this time.
        Another year has passed filled with beautiful memories made and
        unexpected challenges overcome. As we always say: life is unexpected and
        anything can happen. But I'm really glad that you are here living your
        life to the fullest.
