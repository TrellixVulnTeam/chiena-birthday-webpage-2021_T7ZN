        <p>Happy Birthday Ina!!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Can you believe it? Just last year we were all celebrating your
          birthday in your backyard! Those were different times hahaha.. And
          your birthday celebration might look a little different this year, but
          it's definitely no less special üòÅ. Honestlyy thoughh, I have a strong
          feeling that you've already found fun and creative ways to celebrate
          with your loved ones ‚ò∫Ô∏è And as a result, it must be a very unique (and
          possibly more memorable) b-day celebration for you
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You know... its been a real pleasure getting to know you all this
          time. You've proved to be an amazingly trustworthy and supportive
          friend throughout the years, and I can't stress enough how grateful I
          am for you. I'm honored to say that you are one of my close friends
          who really got me through some of the toughest moments in my life so
          far. So thank you for always being there for me. I'm so very lucky to
          know a kind and thoughtful person like you. Life can get really tough
          sometimes with its daunting challenges, but having good friends to
          lean on makes everything soooo much easier
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So another year has passed filled with beautiful memories made and
          unexpected challenges overcome (One of my personal favorite memories
          being when everyone thought you were me in Among Us that one time ü§£).
          And as we always say: life is unexpected and anything can happen.
          Knowing this, I'm extra glad that you are still here living out your
          best life spreading your enthusiasm for tasty food, green tea, and
          Start-Up to name a few things üòù. So please keep on being the
          adventurous, free-spirited, and creative Chiena who always inspires me
          to be a more confident version of myself ok? I'm wishing you another
          wonderful year, and I hope you treat yourself a lot today! üòä

        <p>
          PPS I hope you enjoy the bday goodies I got you! I'm not really a
          baker, so hope the burnt cheesecake is suitable for your tastebuds üòã
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          PPPS Ok ok so I know your favorite dessert is def not cheesecake, but
          I figured you would be eating a lot of your fav stuff today and maybe
          you'd get tired of eating the same thing?? The thing is, I don't
          remember how much you like cheesecake LOL. Sooooo if you actually hate
          cheesecake uhh this is awkward üòÇ At least it'll make for a funny
          story
