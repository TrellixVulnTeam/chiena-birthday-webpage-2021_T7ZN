      <p>Happy Birthday Chiena!!</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Can you believe it? Just last year we were all celebrating your birthday
        in your backyard! Those were different times hahaha.. And your birthday
        celebration might look a little different this year, but it's definitely
        no less special üòÅ. Honestlyy thoughh, I have a strong feeling that
        you've already found fun and creative ways to celebrate with your loved
        ones ‚ò∫Ô∏è And as a result, it'll be a very unique (and possibly more
        memorable) b-day celebration
      </p>
      <br />
      <p></p>

        You know... its been a real pleasure getting to know you all this time.
        You've proved to be an amazingly trustworthy and supportive friend
        throughout the years, and I can't stress enough how grateful I am for
        you. I'm honored to say that you were one of the close friends/family
        who really got me through some of my toughest moments in life so far.

        PPS I hope you enjoy the bday goodies I got you! I'm not really a baker,
        so hope the burnt cheesecake is suitable for your tastebuds üòã

        PPPS Ok ok so I know your favorite dessert is def not cheesecake, but I
        figured you would be eating a lot of your fav stuff today and maybe
        you'd get tired of eating the same thing?? The thing is, I don't
        remember how much you like cheesecake LOL. Sooooo if you actually hate
        cheesecake uhh this is awkward üòÇ At least it'll make for a funny story
